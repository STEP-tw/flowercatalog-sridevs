      <b>Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA)</b>, is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
      and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
      Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central America
      and Mexico but four are native to the United States.

      They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The
      opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are
      slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.

      The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in
      small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
